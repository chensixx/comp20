###Si Chen's space###

1.This repo consists of homework of comp20-web programming.

2.My favortie lab is rickroll because it is more fun as it involved a music video.

3.I think I have grown a lot. I don't know all materials well but I know there are many resources to learn about them.

4.The most important thing is looking for help. One example is during assignment four, I sought help from a cs student who's taking security and knows things better than I do. Another example is during assignment 3 I looked up on google for a lot of javascript functions.

5.I would like to learn more about building a dynamic website, or at least good looking.
